# Mad Libs Game

# Mad Libs is a fill-in-the-blank game based on word types.
# A story template is prepared with certain words left blank.
# The player is asked for words of specific types (e.g., adjective, noun, verb).
# These words are inserted into the blanks of the story template.
# The resulting story is usually funny and entertaining.
# This game is a great way to have fun while learning Python basics!
